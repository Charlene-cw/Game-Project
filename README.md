# Game-Project
This is a game coded with JavaScript

During the development of my game, I implemented several extensions to enhance the overall gameplay experience. One key addition was the platform system, allowing the game character to interact with floating platforms. I also introduced sound effects, including background music and audio cues for jumping, collecting items, and falling into canyons to create a more
immersive experience. Additionally, I refined the enemy mechanics by using constructor functions, allowing for dynamic and reusable enemy behavior that makes the game more challenging and engaging.

One of the most challenging aspects was implementing collision detection for platforms. Initially, the character could pass through them or would not land properly. Solving this required refining how the game checks for platform contact while allowing jumps. Another challenge was handling enemy scaling, as I wanted the number of enemies to increase with each level. This required dynamically generating enemies using constructor functions and ensuring that they moved within a suitable area while maintaining a predictable yet challenging behavior. Adjusting their speed and movement length to keep the gameplay fair was a key challenge in this process.

Throughout this project, I practiced essential skills such as debugging, designing the user interface, and implementing game mechanics using JavaScript. Debugging was crucial in resolving issues with gravity, movement, and enemy behavior, ensuring smooth gameplay. I also worked on designing a user-friendly interface, including clear visual elements and responsive controls to enhance the player experience. Additionally, I learned new techniques like using specialized functions to create and organize game elements, which made my code more efficient and easier to manage. Overall, this project strengthened my problem-solving abilities and deepened my understanding of game development principles.
